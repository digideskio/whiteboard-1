# Frequently Asked Questions

So you've got an effort that you think belongs here: that's fabulous news! Here are some of the questions you might have before you're ready to get things moving, and some guidelines to help things happen in a standard way.

### How do I know when my project is ready to belong here?

While it's not a science, you can probably figure this out :) If it's just an idea, with no code, content, documentation, etc., you're probably too early. None of us want to end up with a giant repo full of empty branches, right?
But once you _do_ have something to show, even if it's just a substantive write-up of your plans, you should start thinking about getting on board. 

### How do I get my project added?

To have a new branch created, you'll need a member of the Learning or Core teams to set it up for you. To submit your request, open an Issue with the prefix `[request-new-project]`.

### I'm working on an existing project; how can I get access to permissions so I can merge PRs and things?

To submit a request, open an Issue with the prefix `[request-permissions]`. 

Please note: unless you are the person creating the project to begin with, we'll look to make sure you have a history of activity before granting access permissions. That means you should've already submitted PRs to the branch, worked with the maintainers, made substantive comments, etc. 
Basically, we'll take a look to make sure your request seems appropriate, and ask around if need be to be sure.

### If I have permissions in general, does that mean I can merge PRs to any whiteboard project?

Technically, you _can_, but should you? Absolutely not. We can't grant permissions on a branch-level, so it _has_ to be on the repo level, but we expect folks to only exercise their powers in the places where it's appropriate. Jumping into a project you're not involved with and committing changes directly or merging PRs is _not_ appropriate. This is presumably obvious :) We'll err on the side of assuming everyone can act responsibly out the gate, and fix problems as needed if they come up.

### My new project/branch exists: what now?

Aside from working on the project itself, recruiting collaborators and more, you'll want to do the following:

* Replace the README.md of your branch with an explanation of what the project is
* Submit a PR to the Master branch of this repo to add your project to the index list in _that_ README.
