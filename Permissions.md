# Permissions

For each new effort (and accordingly, branch) created, a new Team can be created to assign members of that effort permissions for the Whiteboard repo. These teams will have the same `wb-` prefixes as branches do.

As there isn't a way to give a user permissions over just a branch, we'll err on the side of more open and flexible permissions, and rely on etiquette and best practices to keep things in order. TL;DR, even though you may have permissions on the repo, you should only merge things / take admin action on branches you were _intended_ to have permissions on. The Ember project has a strong history of good community behavior and general citizenry and we'll rely on that.

Even for those who _have_ been granted permissions, best practice is still to always submit content via PR. At the beginning of an effort that could easily mean one person ends up submitting and merging their own PRs, and that's alright. It's still ideal to follow general proper procedures from the start.

For questions about permissions, or to make requests, feel free to file an issue or reach out to a member of the Learn Team.
